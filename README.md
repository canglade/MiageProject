# How to start

Execute the script named "Install.bat"
Wait a few minutes and then you'll have to say "no" each time it will be asked by yo, except for bootstraps' install.
At a moment you'll be asked which angular's components you want to install, choose only "angular-route.js" and "angular-animate.js" (with the "space-bar", press "Enter" when finished)

Now you will need to setup your MongoDb folder in the file server_launcher/mongodblaunch

And finally launch the script "Launch.bat", PWIL will automaticly be opened in your favorite browser
